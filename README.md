# John Conway's Game of Life Simulator

### About 
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is an single-player cellular automaton game played on a infinite grid of cells. Each cell on the game board has two possible states, alive or dead. A cell's state during each generation depends on the state of the surrounding eight tiles, and is decided through the following rules.

### Rules 
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by another [Game of Life simulator](https://playgameoflife.com/) created by Edwin Martin. My goals for this project were to challenge myself to learn React and Flask, and to learn more about Conway's Game of Life. 

### Next Steps
* Expand the board to infinite cells
